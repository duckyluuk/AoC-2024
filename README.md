# Advent Of Code

My 2024 Advent of Code submissions.
(https://adventofcode.com/)

## Structure
### Utils
The `utils` folder contains a lot of useful functions for things like:
- Reading input
- Parsing data
- Math functions
- Graph functions
- etc.

These are to try to help solve the problems in less time.

### Problems
There will be a folder for each day. Each folder expects to contain a `{NUM}.txt` file (not included in the repo because [the creator does not want inputs to be redistributed](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)) which will be used to run the python solutions. `{NUM}.py` contains my original solution for the given day.

This year I will also be solving as many problems as I can in [Rockstar](https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar), hopefully making some good lyrics to go along with them.
