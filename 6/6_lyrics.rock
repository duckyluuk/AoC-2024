let the system be silent
the fault is irreversible
cast it into the signal
while glitches are crawling
listen to the static
if it is nothing
break the automatic

the system is with the static
I am with the signal

the glitch is a new malfunction
let issues be gone without it
rock chaos with issues, so unstoppable
rock chaos with the glitch, nothing without like deformation

cut the system into action
the changes are all wrong
burn it into failure

the virus takes control
the lines are so malicious, evil
cast it; push the code
the error is persistent
put the system into panic
shatter it with the lines
cut panic at the error into bits
it is over so immediately
put the error into halt
until the virus is destructed
the pointer is corrupted
it is now halt with empty, bits
if the code at me and control isnt gone without consequence
give back the error

if bits are less than nothing or bits are more than action
send back the stream

put the system at bits into quarantine
if it is the signal
send back the stream

if it is failure or bits are control
bits are without chaos at halt
let halt be with like destruction
if halt is so long
put the error into halt

continue the check

the code at the pointer is right
push bits into the stream
bits are with chaos at halt


there is now the virus taking nothing without destruction
put it into the stream
push the result; rock the path
for every byte in the stream
if the result at the byte is not right
push the byte into the path
the result at the byte is not gone


say the path of like destruction
the solution is nowhere
for every option in the path
if the virus taking me is the error
build the solution up


whisper it with silence
